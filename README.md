# Fund-Performance-Evaluation
This Project is an assignment in FINA 5422(Financial Econometrics and Computational Methods I) at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.    

In the script, I investigated and compared several mutual funds' performances in last ten years. I picked six JP Morgan and Black Rock fund and separated them into three categories (US Large Cap, US Small Cap, US vs China). 
- JPMorgan U.S. Research Enhanced Equity Fund (Large Cap Fund with growth potential)  
- JPMorgan Small Cap Equity Fund (small Cap Fund)  
- JPMorgan Equity Income Fund (low volatility respect with Makret)  
- BlackRock SP-500 Growth ETF fund (Large Cap Fund with growth potential)  
- BlackRock Russell 2000 ETF fund (small Cap fund)  
- BlackRock MSCI China-ETF fund (Investing Chinese stock Makret)

  By cumulating each fundâ€™s monthly return, we can find out the return by holding funds for one year. From the graph, it is clear that in Large Cap and Small Cap sectors, JP Morgan and BlackRock's fund performance is similar. In Large Cap sector, Black Rock's SP-500 Growth ETF fund generates more return for investors. However, By comparing investing in US or China, we can clearly tell investing US fund is much better.

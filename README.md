# Fund-Performance-Evaluation
This Project is an assignment in FINA 5422(Financial Econometrics and Computational Methods I) at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.    

In the script, I investigated and compared several mutual funds' performances in the last ten years. I picked six JP Morgan and Black Rock fund and separated them into three categories (US Large Cap, US Small Cap, US vs China). 
- JP Morgan U.S. Research Enhanced Equity Fund (Large Cap Fund with growth potential)  
- JP Morgan Small Cap Equity Fund (small Cap Fund)  
- JP Morgan Equity Income Fund (low volatility with respect Market)  
- Black Rock SP-500 Growth ETF fund (Large Cap Fund with growth potential)  
- Black Rock Russell 2000 ETF fund (small Cap fund)  
- Black Rock MSCI China-ETF fund (Investing in Chinese Stock Market)

By cumulating each fund’s monthly return, we can find out the return by holding funds for one year. From the graph, it is clear that in Large Cap and Small Cap sectors, JP Morgan and BlackRock's fund performance is similar. In the Large Cap sector, Black Rock's SP-500 Growth ETF fund generates more return for investors. However, By comparing investing in US or China, we can clearly tell investing US fund is much better.

Then, I ran a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate investing one dollar into each fund for 60 months. We can see BlackRock’s large-cap fund truly outperform JPMorgan’s, and BlackRock’s small Cap Fund are the same as JPMogran’s. And holding US high dividend stock is better than holding Chinese stock ETF. From the last sub-figure, we can tell BlackRock SP-500 Growth ETF fund outperform all other five funds.
